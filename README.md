   If you choose 'yes' when prompted during setup, the script will guide you through creating SSH and GPG keys for secure Git operations.

5. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

## What the Setup Does

The `setup.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. Symlinks configuration files to your home directory.
2. Installs Homebrew if not already present.
3. Installs a curated list of Homebrew packages and casks.
4. Sets Zsh as the default shell.
5. Configures fzf for fuzzy finding.
6. Applies custom MacOS preferences.
7. Sets up a global gitignore file.
8. Installs Visual Studio Code extensions.
9. Installs Neovim plugins.
10. Optionally sets up SSH and GPG keys for Git.

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and modify any configurations to suit your needs. Here are some common customization points:

- **Homebrew Packages**: Edit the `Brewfile` to add or remove packages.
- **Zsh Configuration**: Modify `.zshrc` to change shell behavior, aliases, or add new functions.
- **Git Configuration**: Adjust `.gitconfig`, `.gitconfig-personal`, and `.gitconfig-work` for your Git preferences.
- **VS Code Settings**: Update `vscode/settings.json` and `vscode/extensions.txt` for your ideal VS Code setup.

## Maintaining Your Dotfiles

To keep your dotfiles up to date:

1. Make changes to the relevant files in your `~/dotfiles` directory.
2. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
3. On other machines, pull the latest changes and re-run `./setup.sh`.

## Optional: SSH and GPG Setup

If you choose to set up SSH and GPG keys during the installation:

1. The script will generate new SSH keys for personal and work use.
2. It will also create GPG keys for signing your Git commits.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your information.
4. After setup, add the displayed public keys to your GitHub account(s).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during setup, check the console output for error messages.
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to install software on your machine.
